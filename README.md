# Element-L Game
## Introduction
Element-Ls is a game where the player tries to guess the mystery element L.
The player obtains information about the element in order to guess it.
A player wins by guessing an element, and they lose by running out of fetches.

IMPORTANT: Element-Ls is to be played with a periodic table on hand.
## Basic Game Structure

A player uses information "fetches" to get hints about the element. The player can guess the element's row, column, family, or metallic state. If the player is incorrect, they lose a fetch.
Incorrectly guessing an element costs 2 fetches instead of 1. Obtaining the result of (atomic number % 3) also costs 1 fetch.

## Periodic Table Information
Periodic rows range from 1 to 7. Lanthanides and actinides get special columns (LA), and column 8B is split up. The periodic columns are as listed (from left to right):

	1A, 2A
	1LA, 2LA, 3LA, 4LA, 5LA, 6LA, 7LA, 8LA, 9LA, 10LA, 11LA, 12LA, 13LA, 14LA
	3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 8B, 9B, 0B, 1B, 2B
	3A, 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A

There are 10 families used in this game, as listed below:
- alkali metal
- alkaline earth metal
- transition metal
- lanthanide
- actinide
- post transition metal
- metalloid
- reactive nonmetal
- halogen
- noble gas
	
### Specific Notes:
- Reactive nonmetals are any nonmetals that are not halogens or noble gasses.
- There are only 6 elements considered metalloids: boron (5), silicon (14), germanium (32), arsenic (33), antimony (51), and tellurium (52).
- Polonium (84), nihonium (113), flerovium (114), moscovium (115), and livermorium (116) are considered post-transition metals. Tennessine (117) is considered a halogen, while oganesson (118) is considered a noble gas.
- The three metallic states are metal, nonmetal, and metalloid. Metalloids are the only family that are metalloids, while nonmetals consist of reactive nonmetals, halogens, and noble gasses. All other families are metals.
## Difficulty Levels
There are 4 different difficulties to this game: hydrogen (easy), iron (medium), gold (hard), and uranium (very hard).
Hydrogen allots a user 13 guesses, iron allots 10, gold allots 7, and uranium allots only 4.
The hydrogen level is almost always guessable, while the uranium level will almost always require some luck.

The player can choose their difficulty level, as well as whether they would like to play with the lanthanide and actinide series or not. Playing with these series makes the game more diffucult, but also allots 2 extra information fetches.

Good luck playing Element-Ls!
